## Introduction

The Foreground Card UI Project is a UI component built using React and Tailwind CSS. It provides a clean and interactive way to display a set of cards that can be dragged within a defined area. Each card can display an icon, a description, file size, and a customizable tag.

## Features

- **Draggable Cards**: Cards can be dragged and moved around the screen.
- **Customizable Content**: Each card can be customized with different descriptions, file sizes, and tags.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: The project is built with reusable React components, making it easy to extend and customize.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. This project requires Node.js version 14.x or higher.
- **npm or Yarn**: You will also need npm (which comes with Node.js) or Yarn as a package manager.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foreground-card-ui.git
   cd foreground-card-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:

   Start the development server to view the application locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

### Customizing the Cards

To customize the content displayed on the cards, you can modify the `data` array in the `Foreground.jsx` file. Here is an example:

```javascript
const data = [
  {
    desc: "Custom description for the card.",
    filesize: "1.2mb",
    close: false,
    tag: { isOpen: true, tagTitle: "Open Now", tagColor: "blue" },
  },
  // Add more card objects as needed
];
```

### Modifying the Layout

You can adjust the layout and styling of the components by editing the respective JSX and CSS classes in the following files:

- **Background Component**: `src/components/Background.jsx`
- **Card Component**: `src/components/Card.jsx`
- **Foreground Component**: `src/components/Foreground.jsx`

### Adding New Features

To add new features, create new components in the `src/components/` directory and include them in the relevant files as needed.

## Documentation

### Components Overview

- **Background.jsx**: This component renders the background of the application, which includes a fixed heading and a central text element.
- **Card.jsx**: A reusable component that displays a card. It includes an icon, description, file size, and a tag. The card is draggable within the constraints defined by the `useRef` hook.
- **Foreground.jsx**: This component manages the layout of multiple `Card` components. It uses the `useRef` hook to allow cards to be draggable within a defined area.
- **App.jsx**: The main component that combines `Background` and `Foreground` components to render the entire UI.

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the styles by modifying the utility classes directly in the JSX files or by updating the Tailwind configuration.

### State Management

Currently, the project does not use any state management library. State is managed locally within the components using React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks.
